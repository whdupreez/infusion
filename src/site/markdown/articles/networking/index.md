# Networking

A computer network is a group of two or more computer systems connected together in a way that enables the sharing of information. Connections are established between nodes on the network which necessitates some form of identification or addressing scheme.

Computer networks consist of hardware, software and protocols which together form the infrastructure of a network. The arrangement of these elements is also referred to as the topology of the network. Network protocols define how two nodes in the network communicate. Protocols are commonly documented using a layered network architecture model. Collectively the layers form a network stack. The protocol stack consists of all layers, from the physical layer all the way up to the application layer.

## OSI Reference Model

The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model (<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/activities/Communications/TG11/s020269e.pdf">ISO/IEC 7498-1</a>) is an effort by the International Organization for Standardization (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html">ISO</a>) to standardize computer networks. The OSI Reference Model provides a common basis for the coordination of the development of the standards for systems interconnection. It allows existing standards and systems to be placed into perspective within the overall Reference Model.
